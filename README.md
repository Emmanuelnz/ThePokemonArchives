# ThePokemonArchives
This app was developed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Bootstrap and jQuery were also used in the process.
The app is about Pokémon. It provides a list of Pokémon names you can click on to view. Clicking the Pokémon displays thier image and some of thier basic stats/details. 
THe app features a search bar that can be located in the navigation bar at the top. The search bar allows you to search through the page and find the pokemon you're looking for without having to look through them all manually. 
The navigation bar also includes a "Home" and "About" buttons/links you can click. 
The "Home" takes you to the top of the page or ,as the name implies, the home page. 
The "About" option presents a modal with details about the app.
The "The Pokémon Archives" logo all the way on the left of the navigation bar acts as a second "Home" button/link and will also take you to the top of the page or "Home" page.
